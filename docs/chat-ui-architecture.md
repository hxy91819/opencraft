# ChatUI integration architecture

## Target

OpenCraft uses the latest Codex AppServer `Thread -> Turn -> Item` protocol. The
AppServer remains the business write authority. ChatUI consumes one normalized
Conversation Read Model: a V4 ReplicaClient for a V4-native Authority, or a
snapshot-oriented compatibility projection for Codex V3 Resume. Web and Native
surfaces share identity, projection, runtime commands, Composer documents and
design tokens. They do not share a renderer or editor implementation.

## Non-negotiable boundaries

DSH terminal adaptation follows the HyperNode reference contract: completion,
interruption and failure notifications are lifecycle summaries (`itemsView:
"summary"`), never empty full Item snapshots. Full membership belongs to
history reconstruction. Visible reasoning, assistant and tool Items settle
before the Turn; only explicit completed output receives final-answer phase.
Like Codex, `final_answer` is an optional Item rather than a prerequisite for a
completed Turn. A Turn with settled commentary or tool activity may complete
without fabricating an answer; a completely empty completed Turn still fails
closed as a provider/runtime contract violation.
Aborted/interrupted runs retain partial output with final-answer phase, blocked/max-token/unknown
terminal reasons fail closed, and failures emit a typed error before completion.
The same terminal policy is consumed by live and history projection.

DSH steering has three distinct ownership states. `queued` remains an editable
next-turn occurrence, `steering` is Host-accepted user input waiting for the
active Turn's next step boundary, and the matching durable `user/message` owns
the transcript after AgentLoop claims it. The Local Host returns a steer command
when the unary DSH RPC accepts it; it must not wait for a later `session/queue`
snapshot or claim event. Conversation Runtime moves a strict queued steer into
the active Turn immediately, then reconciles the optional authoritative
`steering` projection by client-message identity so reconnect and durable handoff
produce neither a blank interval nor a duplicate row. This does not redefine
steer as a hard interrupt: the current provider request and tool step remain
owned by DSH and may finish before the next-step inbox is consumed.

Attachment staging is a Host resource, not a Renderer filesystem convention.
The `opencraft/attachment-staging` capability declares accepted source kinds,
returned location kinds and the byte limit; Composer consumes only the shared
`pending/processing/ready/failed` lifecycle and an opaque `AttachmentRef`.
Local v1 stages `client-bytes` beneath the Local Host data root and returns a
`host-file`; the Renderer never derives a directory from `codexHome` or calls
generic `fs/writeFile` for this workflow. Remote RPC/SFTP and Cloud object-store
adapters may later return `host-file` or `object-url` through the same contract,
but are unsupported until their Host advertises them. Failed or unresolved
attachments block submission and retain their precise error; removing an
unsubmitted ready attachment asks its owning Host to release the staged ref.
Durable history treats `AttachmentLocation` as opaque resource identity. The
owning staging service persists a location-keyed metadata index and implements
an `AttachmentMetadataResolver` that restores the authoritative `AttachmentRef`
display name during hydration. Transcript projection never parses a Host path
or storage directory; history without indexed metadata degrades to a generic
basename without exposing the full location. The Hermes storage adapter can
also lazily backfill a missing index from its own pre-existing owned manifest;
that compatibility remains behind the resolver rather than leaking its layout
into the transcript model.

The source implementations live in `apps/local-agent-host/src/hypernode/`:
TurnManager, DSH tool projection and the engine event/terminal core.
`dsh-execution-record.ts` supplies local clock, replay-stable unique Item
allocation, notification and synchronous pacing ports. One ordered ledger is
used for live snapshots and native history replay, including active reasoning.
The local HTTP/mux transport, product-owned models and credentials remain host
ports; HyperNode SSH tenancy and per-workspace process launch are not local
execution policy. See [migration contract](../design/dsh-engine-migration.md).

1. A conversation is identified by `(hostId, threadId)`. A bare `threadId` is
   not a cross-host identity.
2. React components never import a WebSocket, JSON-RPC client, Electron bridge,
   Session View store or Replica Journal entry.
3. `appserver-session` may translate Codex V3 Resume/history into the common
   reader contract. Its local View revisions are snapshot continuity hints,
   not a server-sequenced V4 Journal.
4. A Transcript, Timeline Frame and Timeline Block are disposable projections.
   They never become a second persistence authority.
5. ProseMirror and Native editor documents are adapters. Persisted drafts use
   `ComposerDocument` from `@opencraft/composer-core`.
6. Submission freezes an immutable `SubmitIntent`; no UI calls
   `send(blocks): boolean` in the final architecture.
7. Unknown AppServer Item types render an explicit fallback Block. Protocol
   growth must not blank the conversation surface.

## Package ownership

Composer model discovery is a model-only catalog. Product Bot identity is
owned by the Bot protocol and is not duplicated as a hidden Agent picker.
Bot execution failures keep the stable member and execution identity across
history replay and live updates. Their error category is shown beside the
failed execution; raw provider diagnostics stay at the Host and are never
converted into a fabricated Bot message.
Reasoning controls are derived exclusively from each model's declared effort
set: an empty set hides the control, `none` means disable only when explicitly
declared, and the model default must be a member of the same set. Hermes maps
its Session-owned effort through the existing AppServer model/Turn fields;
provider-specific wire clamping remains inside Hermes Runtime.

The Composer permissions menu contains only declared permission profiles, without
an AppServer-default row or explanatory question. An absent or null draft choice
inherits the runtime's effective profile for display only; rendering never writes
that derived value into the draft. Until resolved, the trigger reads `Permissions`
and no profile is checked. Explicit choices still use the existing submit path.

Temporary Side Chat forks are adopted by `ThreadResumeCoordinator.adoptFork` from
the validated `thread/fork` response in its original connection generation. They
use the same metadata/notification projectors and Replica reader, but never issue
a rollout Resume or persistent queue query. Their history source is `fork` and a
lost connection expires that temporary baseline. See the [workspace design](../design/README.md).

The Embedded Workbench keeps Sidebar presentation outside this table: the host
product renders its own session list, New conversation action and Explore/Chat
navigation, while the embedded surface exposes session snapshots plus
create/select/rename/delete actions backed by the ordinary AppServer Thread catalog. Thread IDs and
mutation capabilities remain AppServer authority. The host must not copy or
infer a second conversation model, and the embedded surface must not inject
Sidebar DOM or rewrite the host page route. The right canvas is an
OpenCraft-owned presentation and may reuse the standard Header, Composer,
and Timeline implementations. The embedded product does not project
OpenCraft's Right Panel or its toggle.

New conversation starts as a client Draft. The host Sidebar may mark that Draft
as selected, but it must not invent a Thread row or ID; the first accepted
submission promotes the Draft and AppServer then publishes the canonical Thread
into the recent-conversation list.

Hermes-backed session mutations stay on that same authority path. Rename uses
`thread/name/set` and the bridge's native `session.title`; irreversible
delete uses `thread/delete`, closes a live Hermes session, then invokes
`session.delete`. UI adapters must retain the operation Promise long enough
to expose pending and failure state.

All floating primitives in that canvas resolve through one Workbench
Presentation Root. This includes Composer model/effort menus, Draft project and
Host selectors and application modals. The root also owns the
semantic theme variables required by those primitives; a Portal must never fall
back to the embedding product's document body.

## Current migration ledger

### Established

- AppServer client, WebSocket, memory and Replay transports.
- Resume strategies for legacy, tail, paginated and Durable history.
- V4 Replica authority/client/storage primitives and V3 compatibility source.
- Cross-host `ConversationKey` and opaque Turn/Item identities.
- Extensible Timeline projector registry with an unknown fallback.
- User, assistant, event and interaction Frames.
- Typed Blocks for text, reasoning, execution, patch, tools, plan, todo,
  subagents, approval, question, errors, compaction and images.
- Portable Composer Document/Draft/Target/SubmitIntent and target-scoped drafts.
- A Conversation Runtime that derives its snapshot from a Replica reader only.
- `AppServerWorkbenchRuntime` with per-Thread Replica clients, typed command
  ports, reconnect and stable Thread selection.
- Real WebSocket bootstrap for Web and Expo; IndexedDB on Web and Expo SQLite
  on Native cache only painted state beneath Replica authority.
- Web ProseMirror and Native input adapters controlled by the same
  `ComposerController`; submission freezes an immutable `SubmitIntent`.
- A typed Composer-to-AppServer compiler for new/fork/turn/steer/queue,
  interrupt, approvals and questions.
- Web and RN Timeline renderers consuming the same Turn/Frame/Block projection.
- Codex `VirtualizedTurnList` constants and algorithms: one full-height list,
  Turn-count overscan, measured-height anchor compensation, route restore,
  common geometry/scroll API, and parent latest-Turn follow reducer.

### Compatibility boundary

- `appserver-session` currently materializes a Thread View before exposing it
  through the ReplicaClient-shaped reader. This is the compatibility ingestion
  boundary, not proof that Codex V3 has a V4 Authority or retained Journal.
- `DisplayTurn` remains exported only for older fixtures. Neither application
  host uses it as its conversation read model.
- Browser attachment blobs require a compatible Host attachment-staging
  capability before they can become server-readable AppServer attachments. The
  compiler remains a final fail-closed boundary, not the primary upload-state UI.
- LightVela Hermes advertises that capability only when its authenticated
  Dashboard filesystem exists. Client bytes are staged under the controlled
  `<codexHome>/opencraft-attachments/<client-id>` directory with a durable
  manifest, a location-keyed display-metadata index, replay/content checks and
  bounded recursive removal. Images may continue to use the independent inline
  data-URL path.

### Production hardening, not architecture blockers

- Implement a fully rich Native text editor adapter rather than flattening rich
  display into the current native text-input surface.
- Add Remote RPC/SFTP and Cloud object-store attachment-staging adapters, plus a
  Native client-bytes producer, without changing Composer lifecycle semantics.
- Tune platform-specific response-spacer animation curves while retaining the
  shared Codex placement and follow state machine.
- Split the large desktop renderer chunk at explicit capability boundaries.

## Evidence required for completion

Both apps have removed `createDemoWorkbenchRuntime`. Deterministic Memory and
Replay suites cover create/list/resume/page/send/stream/interrupt/retry,
interaction RPCs, cursor gaps and reconnect. The live 9988 gate deliberately
uses the existing canonical Thread read-only: it proves WebSocket → Session →
Replica authority, forced disconnect, reconnect and same-Thread recovery
without mutating a user's conversation. Production Web, Expo Web and iOS
bundles are independent quality gates; a static fixture alone is not accepted.
